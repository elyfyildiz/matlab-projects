Created x and y vectors from âˆ’5 to 5 with a spacing of 0.5. Considered the function z = sin(sqrt(x2 + y2))

* (a) The mesh plot function was used to generate a three-dimensional z-graph.

* (b) The surf plot function was used to generate a three-dimensional z-graph.
* (c) The surface plot was replaced with interpolated shading using different color maps.
* (d) Created a contour plot of z. Handle graphics and the clabel function were used to label the contour lines.
* (e) Generated a combination surface and contour plot of z.
* (f) 5 different plots were created. To show them in a single way, the subplot function was used.
